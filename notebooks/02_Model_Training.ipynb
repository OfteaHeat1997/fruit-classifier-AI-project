    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will train a deep learning model to classify fruit images into 9 categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fruits:** Apples, Bananas, Oranges  \n",
    "**Ripeness stages:** Fresh, Rotten, Unripe  \n",
    "**Total classes:** 3 fruits × 3 stages = 9 classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I will do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup** - Import libraries and configure GPU\n",
    "2. **Load Data** - Prepare training and test datasets\n",
    "3. **Build Model** - Use transfer learning with MobileNetV2\n",
    "4. **Train Model** - Train for 20 epochs with data augmentation\n",
    "5. **Evaluate** - Test the model and analyze results\n",
    "6. **Save Model** - Export for future predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm using **transfer learning** instead of training from scratch because:\n",
    "- MobileNetV2 already knows how to recognize objects (trained on ImageNet)\n",
    "- I only need to teach it MY specific fruit classes\n",
    "- Much faster training (hours instead of days)\n",
    "- Better accuracy with limited data\n",

    "### Step 6: Data Preparation\n",
    "**What I did:** Preprocessed images and applied data augmentation (rotation, flip, zoom, shift)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Modeling\n",
    "**What I did:** Built and trained a CNN using transfer learning:\n",
    "- Base model: MobileNetV2 (pre-trained on ImageNet)\n",
    "- Custom classification head for 9 fruit classes\n",
    "- Training: 20 epochs with Adam optimizer\n",

Because the model needs to see the data multiple times to learn patterns\n\n---\n\n**`507/507 [==============================]`**\n- **507** is the number of BATCHES (groups of images)\n- We don't process all 16,000 images at once (computer can't handle it)\n- Instead: 16,217 images ÷ 32 images per batch = 507 batches\n- The progress bar `[====]` shows how many batches are complete\n- When you see `507/507`, it means this epoch finished processing all images\n\n---\n\n**`1034s 2s/step`**\n- **1034s** = Total time for this epoch (17 minutes and 14 seconds)\n- **2s/step** = Average time per batch (2 seconds to process 32 images)\n- **Why so slow?** We're using CPU instead of GPU\n- With GPU, this would be ~0.1s/step (much faster!)\n- Don't worry - the model still learns the same, just takes longer\n\n---\n\n**`loss: 0.4721`** ⬇️ WANT THIS TO GO DOWN\n- **Loss** = How \"wrong\" the model's predictions are\n- **Think of it like:**\n  - Loss = 0 → Perfect, never wrong\n  - Loss = 1 → Pretty bad, making lots of mistakes\n  - Loss = 10 → Terrible, completely confused\n- **0.4721** is actually pretty good for the FIRST epoch!\n- As training continues, this number should **DECREASE**\n- By epoch 20, we want to see something like 0.04\n\n---\n\n**`accuracy: 0.8532`** ⬆️ WANT THIS TO GO UP\n- **Accuracy** = Percentage of predictions that are correct\n- **0.8532** = **85.32% correct** on training data\n- This means out of 100 predictions, 85 are right, 15 are wrong\n- **85% on the FIRST epoch is AMAZING!** (because of transfer learning)\n- Without transfer learning, first epoch would be ~20-30%\n- Goal: Get this above 90% by the final epoch\n\n---\n\n**`val_loss: 0.1234`** ⬇️ WANT THIS TO GO DOWN (VALIDATION LOSS)\n- **Validation loss** = Loss on TEST data (images the model has NEVER seen)\n- This is THE MOST IMPORTANT metric!\n- Why? Because it shows if the model can handle NEW fruit images\n- **0.1234** is BETTER than training loss (0.4721) → EXCELLENT SIGN!\n- This means the model isn't just memorizing, it's actually learning patterns\n- **When val_loss > loss:** Warning sign of overfitting (memorization)\n- **When val_loss < loss:** Great sign! Model generalizes well\n\n---\n\n**`val_accuracy: 0.9567`** ⬆️ WANT THIS TO GO UP (VALIDATION ACCURACY)\n- **Validation accuracy** = Accuracy on TEST data\n- **0.9567** = **95.67% correct** on images it's never seen before!\n- This is BETTER than training accuracy → Exceptional!\n- This means:\n  - Model learned general patterns, not specific images\n  - It will work on YOUR fruit photos\n  - No overfitting happening\n- **Goal:** Keep this above 85% (our success criteria)\n\n---\n\n### What You Want to See as Training Progresses:\n\n**✅ GOOD TRAINING:**\n```\nEpoch 1:  loss: 0.47  acc: 0.85  val_loss: 0.12  val_acc: 0.96\nEpoch 5:  loss: 0.15  acc: 0.95  val_loss: 0.08  val_acc: 0.97\nEpoch 10: loss: 0.05  acc: 0.98  val_loss: 0.05  val_acc: 0.98\nEpoch 20: loss: 0.04  acc: 0.99  val_loss: 0.05  val_acc: 0.99\n```\n- Loss going DOWN ⬇️\n- Accuracy going UP ⬆️\n- Val accuracy staying close to training accuracy\n- **Result:** Model is learning well!\n\n---\n\n**❌ BAD TRAINING (Overfitting):**\n```\nEpoch 1:  loss: 0.47  acc: 0.85  val_loss: 0.12  val_acc: 0.96\nEpoch 5:  loss: 0.15  acc: 0.95  val_loss: 0.18  val_acc: 0.92\nEpoch 10: loss: 0.05  acc: 0.98  val_loss: 0.45  val_acc: 0.85\nEpoch 20: loss: 0.01  acc: 0.99  val_loss: 0.89  val_acc: 0.75\n```\n- Training accuracy going UP ⬆️\n- Validation accuracy going DOWN ⬇️\n- Big gap between train and val accuracy\n- **Problem:** Model is MEMORIZING training images, not learning patterns\n- **Solution:** Stop training early, add more dropout, use more data augmentation\n\n---\n\n### Why Transfer Learning Makes First Epoch So Good:\n\nWithout transfer learning (training from scratch):\n```\nEpoch 1: accuracy: 0.15 (15% - barely better than guessing)\n```\n\nWith transfer learning (what we're doing):\n```\nEpoch 1: accuracy: 0.85 (85% - already pretty good!)\n```\n\n**Why the difference?**\n- MobileNetV2 already knows how to \"see\" (trained on 1.4 million images)\n- It knows edges, textures, colors, shapes\n- We just teach it \"this combination = fresh apple\"\n- It's like hiring an expert photographer vs teaching someone from scratch\n\n---\n\n### What Happens During Each Epoch:\n\n**Step 1:** Model looks at batch 1 (32 images)\n- Predicts what each fruit is\n- Compares predictions to true labels\n- Calculates how wrong it was (loss)\n\n**Step 2:** Model adjusts its \"brain\" (weights)\n- Makes tiny changes to improve\n- Goal: Be less wrong next time\n\n**Step 3:** Repeat for batches 2, 3, 4... up to 507\n\n**Step 4:** Test on validation data\n- Use the NEW weights to predict validation images\n- Calculate validation loss and accuracy\n- This checks if changes actually helped\n\n**Step 5:** Start epoch 2 with the updated weights\n\n---\n\nThis process repeats 20 times. Each time, the model gets a little bit better at recognizing fruit ripeness!",

    "\n",
    "3. **Model architecture matters**\n",
    "   - MobileNetV2 is fast and lightweight\n",
    "   - Perfect for mobile deployment\n",
    "   - Good balance of accuracy and speed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges faced:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class imbalance:** Some fruits had fewer images than others\n",
    "   - Addressed with data augmentation\n",
    "   - Could improve with weighted loss in future\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Background variation:** Some images have cluttered backgrounds\n",
    "   - Model learned to focus on fruit despite backgrounds\n",
    "   - Could improve with background removal preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Detailed evaluation** (Notebook 03)\n",
    "   - Confusion matrix to see which classes get mixed up\n",
    "   - Per-class precision and recall\n",
    "   - Error analysis on misclassified images\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deployment**\n",
    "   - Convert to TensorFlow Lite for mobile\n",
    "   - Create Flask API for web access\n",
    "   - Build Flutter mobile app\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Future improvements**\n",
    "   - Collect more data for underrepresented classes\n",
    "   - Try different architectures (EfficientNet, ResNet)\n",
    "   - Implement class weighting for imbalanced data\n",
