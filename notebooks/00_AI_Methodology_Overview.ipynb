    "\n",
    "**The situation:**\n",
    "- When shopping for fruit, it's hard to tell if it's ripe, overripe, or not ready yet\n",
    "- People often buy fruit that goes bad quickly or tastes bad\n",
    "- This wastes money and food\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I want to build:**\n",
    "A mobile app where you take a photo of fruit and it tells you:\n",
    "- **Fresh** → Good to buy now\n",
    "- **Rotten** → Don't buy\n",
    "- **Unripe** → Wait a few days\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:**\n",
    "- Helps people buy better fruit\n",
    "- Reduces food waste\n",
    "- Saves money\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target users:** Anyone who shops for groceries (especially people like me who aren't good at picking fruit!)\n",

    "### My Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem type:** Image classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why image classification?**\n",
    "- I have images of fruit\n",
    "- I need to classify them into categories (fresh/rotten/unripe)\n",
    "- This is a supervised learning problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technique chosen:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Transfer Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why CNNs?**\n",
    "- CNNs are designed for image data\n",
    "- They can learn visual patterns (color, texture, spots, bruises)\n",
    "- They're proven to work well for image classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Transfer Learning?**\n",
    "- Training from scratch takes weeks and huge datasets\n",
    "- Pre-trained models (like MobileNetV2) already know how to \"see\" (detect edges, shapes, colors)\n",
    "- I only need to teach it my specific fruits - much faster!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model selected:** MobileNetV2\n",
    "- Lightweight (works on mobile phones)\n",
    "- Fast inference\n",
    "- Good accuracy\n",
    "- Pre-trained on ImageNet (1.4M images)"

    "\n",
    "**Type of data:** Images of fruit\n",
    "\n",

    "- 3 fruit types: Apples, Bananas, Oranges (common fruits everyone buys)\n",
    "- 3 ripeness stages: Fresh, Rotten, Unripe\n",
    "- Total: 9 classes (3 fruits × 3 stages)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data characteristics needed:**\n",
    "- Different lighting conditions (store lights, natural light)\n",
    "- Different angles (top view, side view)\n",
    "- Different backgrounds\n",
    "- Various fruit sizes\n",
    "- Clear ripeness indicators visible (brown spots for rotten, green for unripe, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantity needed:**\n",
    "- Minimum: 500+ images per class (for basic training)\n",
    "- Ideal: 1000+ images per class (for good accuracy)\n",
    "- My target: ~2000 images per class\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Rotation:** ±20° (fruit can be tilted)\n",
    "- **Horizontal flip:** Mirror image\n",
    "- **Zoom:** ±20% (fruit can be closer/farther)\n",
    "- **Shift:** ±20% (fruit not always centered)\n",

    "\n",
    "**3. Batching:**\n",
    "- Batch size: 32 images per batch\n",
    "- Why? GPU memory limitations + good training stability\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Label Encoding:**\n",
    "- One-hot encoding for 9 classes\n",

    "- Get instant prediction with confidence\n",
    "- Show prediction history\n",

    "- Camera integration\n",
    "- Offline predictions (no internet needed)\n",

    "1. Test on 100 real fruit photos\n",
    "2. Calculate real-world accuracy\n",
    "3. If < 85%, retrain with more augmentation\n",
    "4. If specific fruit fails, add more training images for it\n",
