    "# Fruit Ripeness Classifier — Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** Maria Paula Salazar Agudelo  \n",
    "**Context:** Minor in AI & Society — Personal Challenge  \n",
    "**Portfolio:** Part 2 - Model Training\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will train a deep learning model to classify fruit images into 9 categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fruits:** Apples, Bananas, Oranges  \n",
    "**Ripeness stages:** Fresh, Rotten, Unripe  \n",
    "**Total classes:** 3 fruits × 3 stages = 9 classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I will do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup** - Import libraries and configure GPU\n",
    "2. **Load Data** - Prepare training and test datasets\n",
    "3. **Build Model** - Use transfer learning with MobileNetV2\n",
    "4. **Train Model** - Train for 20 epochs with data augmentation\n",
    "5. **Evaluate** - Test the model and analyze results\n",
    "6. **Save Model** - Export for future predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm using **transfer learning** instead of training from scratch because:\n",
    "- MobileNetV2 already knows how to recognize objects (trained on ImageNet)\n",
    "- I only need to teach it MY specific fruit classes\n",
    "- Much faster training (hours instead of days)\n",
    "- Better accuracy with limited data\n",

    "### Why this matters:\n",
    "- **TensorFlow/Keras:** The main framework for building neural networks\n",
    "- **GPU:** Makes training 10-50x faster than CPU\n",
    "- **Parameters:** Control how the model learns (too fast = bad learning, too slow = takes forever)"

    "## Summary and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Loaded dataset:** ~16,000 training images, ~3,700 test images, 9 classes  \n",
    "✅ **Built model:** MobileNetV2 with transfer learning  \n",
    "✅ **Trained model:** 20 epochs with data augmentation  \n",
    "✅ **Achieved accuracy:** ~85% on validation set (meets project goal!)  \n",
    "✅ **Saved model:** Ready for deployment  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key learnings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transfer learning is powerful**\n",
    "   - Achieved high accuracy with only 20 epochs\n",
    "   - Much faster than training from scratch\n",
    "   - Pre-trained knowledge helps significantly\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data augmentation helps**\n",
    "   - Model learned to handle different orientations\n",
    "   - Reduced overfitting\n",
    "   - Better generalization to new images\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model architecture matters**\n",
    "   - MobileNetV2 is fast and lightweight\n",
    "   - Perfect for mobile deployment\n",
    "   - Good balance of accuracy and speed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges faced:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class imbalance:** Some fruits had fewer images than others\n",
    "   - Addressed with data augmentation\n",
    "   - Could improve with weighted loss in future\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Background variation:** Some images have cluttered backgrounds\n",
    "   - Model learned to focus on fruit despite backgrounds\n",
    "   - Could improve with background removal preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Detailed evaluation** (Notebook 03)\n",
    "   - Confusion matrix to see which classes get mixed up\n",
    "   - Per-class precision and recall\n",
    "   - Error analysis on misclassified images\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deployment**\n",
    "   - Convert to TensorFlow Lite for mobile\n",
    "   - Create Flask API for web access\n",
    "   - Build Flutter mobile app\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Future improvements**\n",
    "   - Collect more data for underrepresented classes\n",
    "   - Try different architectures (EfficientNet, ResNet)\n",
    "   - Implement class weighting for imbalanced data\n",
